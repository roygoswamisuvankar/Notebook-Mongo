# Notebook-Mongo
Tier5 task create a note book application using Nodejs as Backend and mongo as a Database

I tried to do this task using mongodb cloud, But I can't, Then I try to install Mongodb On my system, But there would be a problem occur, my system gives me error while installing moongo in my system, so I do this task using mysql and submit it. Sorry, I can't full fill compiny's requirement. Becase they told me to use mondo but I used mysql. Mysql is SQL database, and this database is much better than NOsql such as mongo, this is my oppinion. I always preffered to used MYSQL types SQL or Ralational Databases, SQL databases are my personal choise.

I create my own respository on github, clone it into my machine, and do all the stuffs.Creating a notebook app,

I export Mysql data base into DataBase Folder.
